//: ## Exercise of Swift Bikeshed Week Three: LangValue
//:
//: ----
//:
//: Detail goes to [link](http://inessential.com/langvalue)

//: (Note: this is a data modeling and error-handling exercise. No tricky algorithms are needed.)
//:
//: **Pretend you’re writing the runtime for a language.**
//:
//: ----
//:
//: It’s a simple language with just three data types: integer, string, and table.
//:
//: ----
//:
//: Your mean, meddling, micro-managing boss told you to use a single thing to represent values in this language, and that thing has to be named LangValue.
//:
//: ----
//:
//: Your mean boss — who hates classes and Objective-C — also said she wants to see two solutions. Here are your choices:
//:* LangValue as an enum.
//:* LangValue as a struct.
//:* LangValue as a protocol, with structs named LangValueInt, LangValueString, and LangValueTable that implement LangValue.
//:* LangValue as a protocol, with extensions to the built-in Swift data types Int, String, and Dictionary that make them implement LangValue.
//:* Pick any two.
